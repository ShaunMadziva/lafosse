// *Direct* students, in pairs, to write a function that does the following:
// * Accepts three arguments: `start`, `stop`, and `final`
// * Counts down from the `start` number to the `stop` number, outputting each number as it does so
// * Instead of the `stop` number, outputs the value of `final`
// * *OPTIONAL* extend the function so that it can handle the possibility of stop being greater than start
